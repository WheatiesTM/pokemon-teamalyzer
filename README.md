Hi there!

You have found the source code for a small Pokemon Team Analyzer (Teamalyzer) web-app that I built!
Try it out on the web here: https://pokemon-teamalyzer.now.sh/

The primary goal of this application is to give both new and experienced players insights into the potential strengths and weakensses of their team, both on defense and offense. To look at a team's defensive profile damage calcs against every type (elemental type) and category (physical or special) are run against the entire team. The results of these damage calculations are displayed in the defensive analysis table at the bottom of the page. Offensively, every damaging move of each member of the team is run against a standard "dummy" opponent of every type combination. The results of these calculations are added together and displayed in the "Offense Analyzer" table at the bottom of the page.

Some additional features of the app are numerical representations of exactly how bulky each Pokemon is and how powerful the offensive moves they are using are. The numbers for bulk and power are worked out to be on the same scale, so a Pokemon with a physical bulk of 100 has a chance to be K.O.ed by a physical move of power 100 (damage from a maximum damage roll).
  
  I hope this app gives you some insights into the strengths and weaknesses of your team! Good luck in your battling!
  
  Special thanks to Austin and Pre from the Smogon Damage Calculator team for the damage calculation package that makes this application work. And thanks to Erick for mentoring me through the application building process.
